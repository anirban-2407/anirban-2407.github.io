      <p>
        I was born and brought up in Howrah, West Bengal, India. I completed my
        undergraduate studies in Physics from the University of Calcutta in 2023
        and obtained my Master of Science degree from the National Institute of
        Technology Tiruchirappalli in 2025.

      <p>
        My academic interests lie broadly in experimental physics, with emphasis
        on optical and spectroscopic techniques for investigating material and
        environmental systems. I am particularly interested in non-destructive
        diagnostics, quantitative data analysis, and interdisciplinary scientific
        applications of physical methods.
      </p>

        During my Master’s research, I studied simulated acid rain stress in Neem
        (Azadirachta indica) using Raman, FT-IR, and UV-Vis spectroscopy, focusing
        on identifying spectral signatures of biochemical and structural changes
        in plant tissues. This work strengthened my foundation in experimental
        design, spectral acquisition, and scientific data interpretation.
      </p>

      <p>
        I remain open to exploring diverse directions in experimental research and
        aim to further develop expertise in advanced instrumentation, scientific
        computing, and data-driven physical analysis.
