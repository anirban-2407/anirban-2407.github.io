    <p>
      I was born and brought up in Howrah, West Bengal, India. I completed my
      undergraduate studies in Physics from the University of Calcutta in 2023
      and obtained my Master of Science degree from the National Institute of
      Technology Tiruchirappalli in 2025.
    </p>

    <p>
      My academic interests lie broadly in experimental physics, with emphasis
      on optical and spectroscopic techniques for investigating material and
      environmental systems. I am particularly interested in non‑destructive
      diagnostics, quantitative data analysis, and interdisciplinary scientific
      applications of physical methods.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my Master’s research, I studied simulated acid rain stress in Neem
      (Azadirachta indica) using Raman, FT‑IR, and UV‑Vis spectroscopy, focusing
      on identifying spectral signatures of biochemical and structural changes
      in plant tissues. This work strengthened my foundation in experimental
      design, spectral acquisition, and scientific data interpretation.
    </p>

    <p>
      I remain open to exploring diverse directions in experimental research and
      aim to further develop expertise in advanced instrumentation, scientific
      computing, and data‑driven physical analysis.
