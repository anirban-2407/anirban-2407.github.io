<h1>Research Experience</h1>

<h2>M.Sc. Thesis Research (2024–2025)</h2>

  <strong>Thesis Title:</strong> Confirmatory Detection and Evaluation of 
  Environmental Stress in Neem (<em>Azadirachta indica</em>)
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. B. Karthikeyan
</p>

<p>
  My Master’s research focused on understanding the biochemical and structural 
  response of plant systems under externally induced environmental stress using 
  non-destructive spectroscopic techniques. The study emphasized reliable 
  spectral indicators capable of distinguishing stressed samples from untreated 
  controls and assessing the extent of physiological alteration.
</p>

<p>
  The experimental observations revealed systematic variations in spectral 
  signatures associated with pigments, carbohydrates, lipids, and structural 
  biomolecules, indicating measurable stress-induced modification in plant 
  metabolism and cellular organization. These findings demonstrate the 
  effectiveness of vibrational and optical spectroscopy as rapid diagnostic 
  tools for monitoring plant health and environmental impact.

<h2>Future Research Interests</h2>

<p>
  Building upon my postgraduate research experience, I aim to further pursue 
  experimental condensed matter and materials physics, with emphasis on optical 
  characterization, functional materials, and interdisciplinary spectroscopic 
  applications. I am particularly interested in connecting microscopic physical 
  mechanisms with macroscopic material behavior through precise experimental 
  measurement and data-driven analysis.
